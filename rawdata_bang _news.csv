"Alastair Hughes, CEO (Asia Pacific) of Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), who was in Bangalore to hold a board meeting of the Asia Pacific region comprising China, Japan, Australia, South East Asia and India, spoke to BusinessLine to share the real estate market sentiment and key issues on corporate leasing.

How is the realty market in India as compared to other countries in Asia Pacific ?

India has seen a dramatic recovery. The hangover did not last very long as it had in 2010-2011. The market is very dynamic here right now. While Asia-Pacific began to recover in 2012-2013, India went through a lull, largely due to lack of business confidence, driven by political situations.

Now, it feels like India is in sync with the rest of Asia-Pacific, which is in recovery mode post the global financial crisis. I would like to admit that 18 months ago, people were talking about China, Indonesia, different parts of South-East Asia and Japan. India didn’t feature much in the conversation with international investors because people were a bit concerned about the direction the country was going in. Now everybody is talking about India.

With India back in the reckoning, what is the likely flow of investment?

In terms of volume of money coming into the market globally, it will be about $125 billion this calendar year. 2007 was the last big investment year at $110 billion. Post the Lehman Brothers crisis, it fell dramatically to $40 billion in 2009.

These numbers include both the buying out of assets and leasing. Of the $125 billion this year, a small proportion of it has flown into India.

For India, the cumulative flow from 2007 till the third quarter of 2014 was around $14 billion. But from January-September of 2014 about $1.3 billion has already come in.

So, out of the $125-billion worth of transactional volume of Asia Pacific investments in 2014, only about $1 billion dollars is for India. Now with a stable Government at the Centre, there could be a potential capital inflow. So, we are looking at Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).

If the Government offers taxation relief, then by March 2015 we shall be looking at $10 billion of REIT that can be listed straight away. The top 18 developers in India have got ready stock that has potential for REIT, the valuation of which is about $10 billion.

Are you considering any time frame for both the REIT and taxation relief?

At this moment, due to double taxation, it does not make sense, something which the industry has represented to the finance minister. We anticipate it by the next financial year or early 2016.

What kind of demand do you expect international investors to have?

At present, we see an increase in liquidity. Last year, about 60 per cent of investment came from outside the UK, which includes the Middle-East, Singapore or China.

Interestingly in Shanghai, which you would consider to be Communist after all, about 40 per cent of buyers came from somewhere outside China. In India, at present, small volumes are coming from outside.

What is the profile of the $1.4 billion committed to India?

It is mostly from foreign direct investment (FDI). If you were to look at institutional Indian private equity, it is half a billion dollars.

So as a proportion, FDI is till more than the Indian institutional investment and the primary reason for that is that in India, insurance companies and pension funds are not allowed to invest in real estate.

Hence, very little institutional money is available other than the pure private equity money that has been raised in the domestic market.

Realty portals filling information gap for buyers
1 Comment   |  October 22, 2014

BANGALORE: When Sameer Rana was looking for a dream property last month, he was spoilt for options in the real estate market. Yet, the 44-year-old investment banker was not sure whether he had all the information to spend Rs 2 crore on an apartment.

“Is the area safe? Are the nearby schools good? Will the builder give possession of the house on time? All such questions plundered my mind and I did not have the time to go through every property myself to decide,” Rana said, adding, “Brokers could not be trusted.”

But now online start-ups, including Housing-.com, PropTiger, and CommonFloor, are setting up their own teams, data science labs and open forums to provide such information. “Technology and analytics will be the biggest differentiator and game-changer in the online real estate industry in the future,” said Rahul Chowdhri, partner at Helion Venture Partners and an investor in real estate portal Housing.com.

Softbank and Accel-backed PropTiger have collaborated with social enterprise SafetyPin to provide information regarding safety quotient of new projects in Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR). “The parameters used to come up with this score include presence of street lights, visibility of vehicles, crowd at important times and access to modes of public transport, among others,” said Prashan Agarwal, co-founder of PropTiger, which is set to expand to other cities soon.

Its larger rival Housing.com was the first online real estate company in the country to launch its in-house data science lab in 2012. The portal focuses on lifestyle rating, locality scores, connectivity scores, child friendliness index and price heat maps across categories, including rentals, resale, paying guest accommodation and new projects across 40 cities.

“Our algorithm takes into account the most basic needs and sought-after luxuries, and weighs them according to their importance. We use around 50 parameters to get this data,” said Advitya Sharma, co-founder of Housing.com. "
"BANGALORE: Online real estate portal CommonFloor has raised $30 million (over Rs180 crore) in its fifth round from existing investor Tiger Global. In January, the Bangalore-based company had raised about Rs 65 crore from Tiger Global and Accel Partners.

Sumit Jain, cofounder and chief executive officer of CommonFloor, confirmed the investment. “We will invest in technology, product development, hiring and expanding to at least 22 new cities in the next one year,” he said.

While the company did not disclose the valuation it received, Jain said that Common Floor expects to earn a revenue of $25 million in the next one year. “We have grown 100% in terms of revenue and traffic since January.”

Jain and his IIT-Roorkee classmate, Lalit Mangal, founded CommonFloor in 2007 along with another friend Vikas Malpani, an alumnus of Visvesvaraya Technological University.

While individual users can list advertisements for buying, selling and renting of property for free, the company earns revenues from builders and brokers who pay a fee.

The housing classifieds market is getting increasingly competitive, with start-ups like Housing.com and Commonfloor backed by venture capital funding, competeting hands on with companies like 99Acres and Magicbricks.

Last week, ET reported that rival property portal Housing.com is in talks to raise as much as $30 million (about Rs 180 crore) from existing and new investors, including Russian venture capitalist Yuri Milner in his personal capacity and Tybourne Capital.

It is estimated that the real estate market in the country will reach $180 billion (over Rs 11 lakh crore) by 2020. In just residential property, the top eight Indian cities will see an additional demand of 2.8 million units in the next five years, according to property consultant Cushman & Wakefield. "
"BANGALORE: Property has always been a major investment avenue of the rich. Now, some of the people one would expect to focus on enterprising ventures are also looking at rent-yielding property.

Infosys co-founder NR Narayana Murthy’s family office has bought high-end luxury apartments in Bangalore and Mumbai, said sources familiar with the development. Catamaran Ventures, which manages part of Murthy’s wealth, has previously invested in e-commerce, FMCG and education ventures.

Another source said that Premji Invest, the family office of Wipro chairman Azim Premji, is also scouting for real estate assets in metros. A couple of years ago, Premji, in his personal capacity, had picked up a few properties in Mumbai that were subsequently rented out, sources in the real estate industry said.

Sources told TOI Catamaran Ventures, which manages Rs 600 crore of funds, had invested at the pre-launch phase, providing scope for steep appreciation once the projects are completed. TOI couldn’t ascertain whether Catamaran is also considering investment in commercial real estate. An email sent to Catamaran remained unanswered at the time of going to press.

Murthy’s colleague and former Infosys CEO S D Shibulal’s penchant for real estate has been much reported. His family office, Innovations Investment Management, has property investments in the US, including in New York and Seattle, as also in Germany and India. In Seattle, it has a portfolio of over 700 apartments. The real estate investments, managed by a professional team, comprise both residential and commercial assets.

Another Infosys co-founder NS Raghavan, through his family office Nadathur Estates, manages an investment portfolio of multiple asset classes, including hospitality and real estate.

“Residential real estate does not bring the highest yields globally, but it is a reliable source of rental revenue coupled with capital appreciation and relatively better monetizing potential than commercial real estate,” said Anuj Puri, country head of real estate consultancy JLL India.

While A-grade commercial office space gives a annual yield of 10% in India, residential properties give an average yield of 3%-4%. In some luxury residential properties, the yield could touch 7%.

“Residential properties sit well on balance sheets and in inheritances, too. Not surprisingly, it is a preferred investment class for Indian HNIs with global reach and business interests,” said Puri.

J Vishnu Shankar, founder of real estate consultancy firm Crorepati Homes, said that much of the investment action by family offices has been happening in top dollar markets like Mumbai and New Delhi. “My guess is that Bangalore has a limited number of properties that cost Rs 20 crore upwards, which is the typical asset class that interests such high-profile buyers,” he said.

"After a lacklustre first half, home sales across the top six cities in the country are expected to rise 26 per cent in the second half of 2014 compared to a year ago, according to a research report by property advisory firm Knight Frank.

A negative sentiment among home buyers due to the slow economy, high interest rates, inflation and also political uncertainty had tempered home sales in the first half of the year. While new launches in the period dropped 32 per cent, sales volume was down 27 per cent.

But now, with a positive election result, a stable government at the centre and sops for the housing sector in the interim budget and other measures to shore up the economy by the new government, there are signs that the tide might be turning.

Mumbai and Bangalore are expected to lead the recovery in sales volume with 49 per cent and 26 per cent growth respectively in the second half of the current year, says the half yearly report by Knight Frank.

New, launches, though, are expected to rise only 5 per cent in the next six months as developers may like to focus on getting rid of their large inventory of unsold homes that has piled up over the quarters.

The national capital region (NCR) saw a drastic drop of 37 per cent in home sales in the first six months of the year to nearly 28,500 units compared to 45,300 units a year ago. Launches of new homes too fell by 43 per cent at 35,500 units during the period but despite the lower number of launches, there were 167,000 unsold units in the NCR market in June which would take at least two years to be sold.

“The government’s intention to revive economy growth of the country seems to have stuck the right cord among investors and we do notice a substantial change in sentiments for the better,” said Shishir Baijal, chairman and managing director of Knight Frank.

Demand for homes in Mumbai, said Knight Frank, dropped by 25 per cent in the first half of 2014 compared to a year ago whole new launches were down 38 per cent. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region has an unsold inventory level of 213,742 units which would take about three years to sell.

The report, however, expects an uptick in the Mumbai property market with four important infrastructure projects coming up in the city including the part-opening of a monorail system, the commissioning of Metro Rail and the Eastern Freeway.

Bangalore as a market has seen healthy demand for homes despite the slowdown however the momentum has somewhat slackened in 2014, said Knight Frank.

In contract with the housing market, the office market has seen an improvement in its fortunes. Vacancy levels have come feom from 21 per cent in the second half of 2012 to 19 per cent in the first half of 2014. The combined absorption of office space in the top six cities has increased from 14.7 million sq ft in the second half of 2012 to 17.9 million sq ft in the half just ended.

Knight Frank forecasts that this will increase to 18.7 million sq ft in the second half of 2014. “For the full year 2014, we expect absorption to touch 36.5 million sq ft, a jump of 8 per cent from the 33.9 million sq ft reported in 2013,” the report said.

"Mid-segment residential properties witnessed the highest appreciation in Bangalore in the past three years, while in the high-end category the credit went to Pune, says a study.

As per the report by global real estate consultants, Cushman and Wakefield, mid-segment residential property prices almost doubled in the north-west part of Bangalore, while they were up nearly two-thirds in some areas of Pune.

The study spanned between first half (January-June) of 2011 and first half of 2014.

In the mid-segment, Chennai with 27 percent, Delhi region with 22 percent and Kolkata with 17 percent, also saw some noteworthy increases, while Mumbai saw the second-lowest jump with 16 percent, following Hyderabad with 14 percent.

In the high-end properties market, Pune recorded the highest increase in capital values of 39 percent while Bangalore recorded 37 percent average increase in capital values in the period between 2011 and 2014.

The high-end property segment in Chennai market recorded an average increase of 34 percent in capital values in the three-year period, while Mumbai and Delhi-NCR recorded identical average increase of 24 percent. Hyderabad with 16 percent remained at the last on the table for average increase in capital values over three years.

“Despite the disparity in levels of average appreciation in capital values in the past, it is heartening to see that against poorer economic sentiments, all markets have recorded capital appreciation. It is interesting to note that markets which are largely end user driven are also the ones to record highest average increases in capital values while investor driven markets such as Delhi-NCR and Mumbai have remained contained in appreciation received over the period,” said Shveta Jain, executive director, Residential Services, Cushman & Wakefield.

“This is largely because of the fact that in the last few years due to factors such as slower economic growth, devaluation of the Indian rupee against dollar and general unrest on account of factors such as inflation, slower rate of real estate development etc. which has led more probable markets of Delhi-NCR and Mumbai to see a slower rate of appreciation,” Jain added.

In the last three years, Bangalore witnessed the highest average capital value appreciation in the mid segment of the top seven Indian cities. Chennai witnessed steady capital value appreciation in both mid and high-end segments during the period, while Hyderabad witnessed capital value appreciation of 14 percent in the mid segment and 16 percent in the high-end segment.

The high-end segment in Kolkata witnessed average capital value appreciation of 26 percent in the last three years. Average capital values in Mumbai’s mid segment increased 16 percent during the period and capital values in Delhi-NCR appreciated 22 percent in the mid segment and 24 percent in the high-end.

Also, the residential segment in Pune witnessed high levels of capital value growth in both the mid and high-end segments."
"BANGALORE/MUMBAI: After a lull of nearly three years, sale of large land parcels is picking up across the country amid a general improvement in sentiment on expectations that the new government will focus on infrastructure development.

Not only developers but private equity (PE) players, too, are keen on joining hands with builders to acquire land parcels at fair valuations without having to pay a premium as corproates try to unbolt the value of their real estate properties, inspiring the realty market out of its trance.

Some of the builders looking for sewing large land transactions include Tata Housing Development Company, Oberoi Realty and Runwal Group in Mumbai, DLF in Delhi, Prestige Estates Projects in Bangalore, VGN Developers in Chennai and Kolte-Patil Developers in Pune. Most of the properties on block are non-core assets, real estate and manufacturing facilities of corporates that can easily be converted to residential or office projects.

“Developers have access to liquidity and are putting war chest together in anticipation of high growth and conducive interest rate,” said Ambar Maheshwari, managing director of corporate finance at property consultancy JLL India. “Such transactions help corporates get money to put into expansion of their core business, while builders get access to clean land that is 30-50% cheaper than the market value.”

In July, Prestige Estates Projects bought an 8-acre prime plot of land in south Bangalore for Rs 345 crore from engineering and electronics conglomerate Siemens.

The deal was preceded by Mumbai-based Lodha Developers buying 87 acre in Thane, near Mumbai, from Clariant Chemicals (India) for Rs1,154 crore and Oberoi Realty’s 25 acre land purchase in suburban Mumbai’s Borivali from Tata Steel for Rs1,155 crore.

A crucial factor like toned down expectations of sellers is also prompting developers to consider deals, which would have otherwise taken longer to conclude.

“With outlook on economy looking positive hereon, we are looking at acquiring land parcels now as values are looking more realistic,” said Sandeep Runwal, director, Runwal Group. He, however, refused comment on the ongoing transaction of Crompton Greaves’ land parcel, for which the developer is believed to be one of the contenders.

Crompton Greaves is looking to sell its 32-acre land parcel in tranches. A stable government that is perceived to be quick in taking firm policy decisions has also boosted confidence of the developers.

“With a stable government in power, we are witnessing slow and steady recovery in the economy and should catch steam with festive season around the corner,” said Brotin Banerjee, CEO and MD, Tata Housing Development Company.

“We believe this is the right time for both consumers and developers to proceed with their purchase decision as these deals may vanish soon. We are utilising this opportunity to increase our footprint of quality land parcels in city centres of major metros as the demand will start picking with improvement in macro economy by end of this year.”

Tata Housing acquired a 7-acre land parcel in Thane from KEC International for Rs225 crore in April. Besides, the developer is looking to invest Rs3,000 crore in acquisition of more land in the premium home category across major cities in the current fiscal.

According to property consultants, over Rs3,100 crore worth of land deals have taken place in the last 6-8 months with similar amount of deals expected to be concluded in the next few quarters. “There is a revived optimism among realty developers,” said Rajeev Bairathi, executive director, capital transactions group & north India at Knight Frank India.

“They know that prices will move upward going forward. Therefore, they are clear about this being the right time to build inventory of the most important raw material for their business — land parcels.” "
"Bangalore/Mumbai: HDFC Property Fund, the private equity arm of Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd, has raised $250 million (around `1,500 crore today) through an offshore fund. It hopes to raise another $150 million by the end of the year, said a person directly familiar with the development who did not want to be named.

On Friday, HDFC Property Fund informed the BSE that it had raised the capital through its second international fund, saying “the recently closed fund will focus on investing primarily in residential property developments in major cities across India”.

The cumulative assets under management now exceed $1 billion, the statement added.

The new fund, which started raising capital in 2012, had targeted a corpus of $500 million. But it has raised only $250 million so far, and decided to do a first close and start the process of investing before attempting to raise another $150 million, said the person cited earlier.

Typically, funds that aim to raise a large corpus raise a certain amount of capital and announce a first close, after which they start investing in deals.

HDFC Property Fund had last raised $800 million through Hiref International Llc, an offshore fund, in 2007.

Its new offshore fund will start investing the capital it has raised and will invest a maximum of `240 crore in each transaction. It will invest in Bangalore, Kolkata, Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR), Pune and Mumbai.

The fund will invest in residential projects and is expecting an internal rate of returns (IRR) of 23-24%.

“We will do structured investment with a portion of equity in these investments,” the person said.

Of the $250 million, the fund has already committed `800 crore across a few deals in Mumbai, Pune and Bangalore.

One of these is the Vrindavan Tech Village project in Bangalore, which is being developed by realty firm Embassy Property Developments Pvt. Ltd and where Blackstone Group Lp is an investor.

HDFC Property Fund will invest around `240 crore in the 30-acre residential component of the project, said a second person familiar with the transaction.

HDFC has raised the offshore fund in difficult capital-raising conditions when global investors are wary of putting their money in the Indian real estate market.

Funds raising offshore capital are, in fact, finding it far more challenging compared with domestic capital, which is still easy to come by.

Financial services firm ASK Group, which plans to raise a $200 million real estate offshore fund, has raised $50 million from global investors on its own and has hired Cushman and Wakefield as a placement agent to help raise the remaining $150 million.

“This (HDFC) fund raise is a sign that foreign investors are back looking at India and they are ready to give capital to Indian funds. The expectations from the government is very high and investors are starting to re-invest in India,” said Ambar Maheshwari, managing director-corporate finance, at property advisory Jones Lang LaSalle India."
"Bangalore: Ansal Properties and Infrastructure Ltd is set to raise Rs.400 crore from Peninsula Brookfield Investment Managers. Peninsula Brookfield is a joint venture between Peninsula Land Ltd and Brookfield Asset Management with Rs.1,000 crore worth of assets under management. The money will be deployed from its maiden fund, Peninsula Brookfield India Real Estate Fund. The transaction is in the last stage of closure and the money will be raised through the non-convertible debenture (NCD) route in the form of structured debt, said two people directly familiar with the transaction. The money is being raised for a massive 2,500 acre development that Ansal had undertaken back in 2009, in a project called Metropolis in Greater Noida. The project, which is under construction, will take another five-six years to complete. “The capital will be used for a mix of things—some of it for project development and some for refinancing earlier loans on the project which will be maturing soon,” said a company executive, who didn’t want to be named. From peak debt levels of Rs.1,800 crore four years back, Ansal has tried to constantly pare debt. Currently, the real estate firm has a gross debt of around Rs.1,050 crore. Property consultant Knight Frank India is the adviser to the transaction. Peninsula Brookfield declined to comment. NCDs have been a popular debt instrument among real estate developers in the past three years. NCDs typically cannot be converted to stock and offer yields of 14-20%. Peninsula Brookfield’s investment strategy is to look at financing and refinancing opportunities, quick turnaround opportunities and buy-in at below intrinsic value with a margin of safety. While looking at deals in key property markets such as Delhi, the National Capital Region, Bangalore and Pune, it partners good quality developers who are in need of capital to restructure their balance sheets or grow. “Investors are not shying away from large projects even though they are long gestation projects. Once the land is acquired and sales start, funding usually comes in where a developer would have sold stock substantially,” said Ambar Maheshwari, managing director, capital markets, property advisory Jones Lang LaSalle India."
"BANGALORE: Engineering and electronics conglomerate Siemens has sold an 8-acre prime plot in south Bangalore to builder Prestige Estates for Rs 345 crore. The Bangalore-based builder entered into an agreement with Siemens on Thursday and has already paid an advance and registered the property on Koramangala Raod, a residential hub for the city’s IT professionals. An official announcement is expected later this week, two persons with direct knowledge of the deal told ET.

The transaction was handled by Juggy Marwah, managing director south India for JLL India, a real estate consultancy firm. Marwah declined to comment. The entire sale procedure for the property, which has been in the market since 2011, lasted six months, said one person in the know. Siemens had earlier entered into an agreement with another Bangalore builder, RMZ Corp, to sell the same land parcel in 2011, but the deal fell through. RMZ had paid an initial instalment of Rs 32 crore to Siemens for this land parcel. According to sources, Siemens has returned 50% of the money to RMZ against the property.

The 8-acre land parcel came under Siemens’ control after a merger of Siemens VDO Automotive’s business with the equipment manufacturer in 2005. Earlier, the land used to house a factory of Siemens VDO Automotive. Koramangala Road is one of the key localities in south Bangalore, largely known for its residential commercial development. Real estate projects here fetch around Rs 9,000 to Rs 15,000 per sq ft depending on the facilities offered by builders. Siemens have been planning to sell land parcel across major cities like Mumbai, Bangalore and Pune as part of its value optimization strategy. Prestige Estates Projects has 59.47 million sq. ft of projects under development across residential, commercial, hospitality and retail. The South-based builder plans to launch 31.96 million sq ft this fiscal with 76% of it to be residential projects followed by commercial and retail. The builder has 377-acre of land bank across South. "
"Companies across industries such as IT, consultancy and e-commerce have begun leasing and buying office space in expectations of an economic boom under a stable central government — a development that will rejuvenate the job market.

Top property consultancies in the country such as Cushman & Wakefield, CBRE, JLL, Knight Frank and DTZ say they have mandates from various corporates to lease about 40 million sq ft of space in the top seven cities this year. With firms planning to use more than half this space for expansion, conservative estimates show that they will create around 350,000 jobs in the process.

“There is a sense of urgency among clients today,” said Viral Desai, director – office at Knight Frank. “While not much has changed in their business so far, with a new government in place, they are preparing for growth. No one wants to miss the bus,” he added. Consulting firm KPMG recently leased over 700,000 sq ft of space in Bangalore and there is buzz in the market that its peers EY, Deloitte and PwC are also looking to ramp up. Many of the big Japanese and Korean firms are looking for space, though demand from the IT industry — doing well on the back of a US recovery — is still the biggest.

Accenture, for example, is looking for about one million sq ft of space in Bangalore, according to property consultants. Another big segment vying for space is e-commerce which has seen multiple rounds of consolidation and entry of big global players such as Amazon and eBay over the last one year, with players adding offices and warehouses on hopes of a boom in consumer spending.

Bangalore-based RMZ said it has already leased 3.25 million sq ft in a business park in the city to corporates such as SAP, Morgan Stanley, ANZ and Honeywell in the last few months. While large scale leasing might not be back just yet, the first signs are here.

“Corporates, both Indian and foreign, foresee 2016 as a big year and they are starting to plan for that growth today,” said Bhumesh Gaur, co-chair at India chapter of CoreNet Global, an association of corporate real estate professionals whose members include over 100 India and foreign corporates. A landslide victory for BJP-led National Democratic Alliance in the general elections triggered the new-found excitement in the corporate sector. “In our conversations with companies till a few months ago they were more interested in maintaining status quo as they were uncertain.

There were no large futuristic calls on expansions. That’s changing now,” said Anckur Srivasttava, chairman of GenReal Property Advisers. Srinivasan Gopalan, chief operating officer at Mumbai-based developer Wadhwa Group, said the company’s leasing pipeline has doubled since the election results to nearly 400,000 sq ft now. “Enquiries have gone up substantially,” he said.

The development will boost the job market, which has slowed down due to subdued economic growth that hit production and consumption. According to an ET Intelligence Group analysis of close to 250 companies belonging to the S&P BSE 500 index, employment growth slowed to 3.5% in FY13 from 5.7% in the year before and 6.4% in FY11. There could be an improvement this fiscal with corporates planning to use about 25 million sq ft of office space they plan to take on lease in top cities such as Gurgaon, Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad and Chennai for expanding their businesses. “There is a lot of positivity in the environment now as challenges of project approvals and capital inadequacies are being done away with.

There is significant expectation of de-congestion of growth from now on. Overall growth expectation for the job market in the next one year is very bullish,” said Rituparna Chakraborty, senior vice president at HR consultancy firm Team-Lease Services. “The challenge for India now is not job creation but finding the right talent and skillset,” he added. Meanwhile, rising demand for office space may lead to supply shortage and high rentals. Over the last few years, as demand for office space declined, as a kneejerk reaction most builders started to defer new office projects and shelved many projects.

According to JLL, across the top seven cities, expected total supply of grade A office space is only about 31 million sq ft in 2014 compared to 44 million sq ft in 2011. “In most cities, enhanced interest from companies has not kept pace with commercial property developers with lack of new launches. The rentals are expected to move up by 5% to 10% this year,” said Ashutosh Limaye, head of research at JLL India. Srivasttava of GenReal Property said he expected office rentals to keep rising constantly over the next five years."
"BANGALORE/MUMBAI: At atime when the Indian property market is showing sluggishness, some private equity firms have exited their investments in real estate companies and locked in good returns too. Of the total institutional PE capital deployed until March 2014, nearly a fifth, amounting to $6.9 billion, has been exited by PE funds, according to a recent report by Brookfield Financial.

This is in contrast to the perception that private equity funds are stuck with their investments and are finding it difficult to make a profitable exit.

Some experts say this trend could get stronger. “Exits in India will accelerate into the second half of this year and next. I would expect that the renewed interest in India, along with a more pressing intent to exit among existing stakeholders, will lead to more volume of deals in the secondary market while residential projects which have matured will generate cash flows to provide investors with an exit,” said Sourav Goswami, principal-head of capital markets at Red Fort Capital, which has invested $1 billion with several successful exits.

According to Jones Lang LaSalle, a property consultancy, returns from Indian real estate for private equity investments with vintage of 2006 stand at 1.1 times compared with the global average of 0.86 times. Performance in the last six years is even better at 1.34x.

“India fares better compared with other property markets, irrespective of whether the exit has come through a third party or promoter buyback. The factor that matters the most is if the fund has derived good returns from its investment or not,” said Shobhit Agarwal, managing director at Capital Markets at JLL India. Depreciation in the rupee, delays in construction, weak economic conditions and sluggish property sales have restricted realty private equity offshore funds’ fresh capital raising efforts and also trapped their earlier investments. But with improvement in the scenario, the renewed confidence seems to be helping fund houses set more optimistic targets.

“With increased confidence among institutional investors and high net-worth individuals due to clarity in macro environment in the backdrop of a stable government, more profitable exits can be expected now,” said Rubi Arya, director and vice-chairman, Milestone Capital Advisors.

“We plan to return .`1,200 crore in this financial year to our investors, which includes about .`700 crore of capital.” Milestone Capital exited seven investments in 2013 with average returns of 22%. The fund has also made some partial exits since January this year.

According to Brookfield Financial, the residential sector accounted for over 58% of the exits and the office sector 24%. Besides, about 85% of the exits were through promoter buy-backs. Since 2005, $37 billion has been raised and deployed in the Indian real estate sector by institutional PE funds.

“PE interest have gone up and we will see the momentum picking up further in the next 2-3 quarters as market improves. Further definitive policy regime and lowering of interest rates will attract more foreign capital in the country,” said Rajeev Bairathi, executive director, capital transaction group and north India, Knight Frank India.

In the quarter to March, PE funds more than doubled their investment in India’s real estate sector on hopes of an improvement in the country’s economy. In the first quarter of 2014, PE funds invested.`2,800 crore in the country’s real estate sector, an increase of 2.3 times compared with the year-ago period, according property consultant Cushman & Wakefield. "
"Reacting to election outcome, Anuj Puri, Chairman and Country Head, JLL India, said: “Housing shortage is legendary, and the Indian Government has always kept low-cost housing in the focus. However, most developers have shied away from focusing on this space because affordable housing is a relatively low-margin business; and in high inflationary scenario, profitability remains a key concern. Equity participation by PE funds has also been limited in the budget housing space.”

“The new Government may look at helping on quicker land acquisition, faster approvals, easy and low-cost funding availability and better infrastructure to make it a more interesting proposition for developers and investors,” he added.

He further added that in Gujarat (the home state of Narendra Modi), the Government has been extending a helping hand to developers who construct low-cost homes, although availability of cheap capital, lengthy approval process and affordable land availability continue to remain challenges."
"BANGALORE: Global private equity funds more than doubled their investment in India’s real estate sector in the quarter to March as they foresee an improvement in economy leading to stable long-term yields, according to a report by brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.

PE funds invested Rs 2,800 crore in the country’s commercial and residential real estate during the period, a 145% jump over the year-ago quarter, the report said. “This is the highest quarterly private equity investment since Q2 of 2009 by private equity funds in the realty sector, driven by huge investment in commercial real estate and steady fund raising by developers in the residential asset class,” it said.

Sanjay Dutt, executive managing director for South Asia at Cushman &Wakefield, said investor interest is expected to grow in office as well as residential property this year. “Improving economic conditions and stable long-term yields are expected to result in increased investor interest for commercial office assets in 2014,” Dutt said. “Considering the attractive returns in the residential sector, along with the high funding needs of developers, steady investments in the residential sector are anticipated.”

The report said average deal size increased 35% to Rs 156 crore per transaction during the quarter. The construction development sector saw foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows worth Rs 1,430 crore in the quarter, which is the highest level of investment since the third quarter of 2009.

The report said global fund houses such as Xander Group, Peninsula Brookfield, Stan-Chart RE and Blackstone committed big bucks to the Indian real estate sector.

While Blackstone and Standard Chartered together invested in Rs 1,150 crore in Vrindavan Tech Village, a special economic zone being developed by Embassy Group on the outskirts of Bangalore, Mantri Developers raised Rs 250 crore from Peninsula Brookfield for a residential project in Bangalore and Oberoi Realty bought a land parcel in Mumbai from Tata Steel for Rs 1,155 crore. “Most investors, especially those who are growth investors, don’t see this sector as a very attractive investment destination currently.

This may be a great opportunity for those who can price the fundamentals, work the real estate, have a longer-term view, a stomach for volatility and patient capital,” said Siddharth Yog, founder and managing partner at Xander Group Inc. Jasmeet Chhabra, principal at Red Fort Capital, said the last three years did not see much FDI in the real estate sector, but things are improving now. “It has become more lucrative in terms of valuation, demand-supply mismatch continues to hold. Once we see a stable government, the deal momentum will pick up,” he said.

While the commercial office sector saw investments worth Rs 1,440 crore during the quarter, the residential sector got Rs 1,070 crore of inflows, contributing about 51% and 38%, respectively, to overall investments mentioned in the report.

“The capital would help fund much needed real estate investment to create and hold facilities to house the economic activities,” said Jonathan Yap, assistant group CEO for overseas funds and India at Ascendas."
